# 🌐 Maqal Panorama

**Maqal Panorama** is a Palestinian digital platform for publishing articles and thoughtful writing across various fields including technology, education, healthcare, culture, art, and social issues.

The name combines:

- **“Maqal” (Article):** representing the core purpose of the platform — written expression.
- **“Panorama”** — symbolizing a wide, inclusive, and transparent view of Palestinian reality.

Our goal is to foster dialogue between writers and readers, spread knowledge, and celebrate the richness of Palestinian culture — all while contributing to a more aware and progressive society.
